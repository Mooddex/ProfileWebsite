## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The site is a simple, clean, and fully responsive profile page. It includes sections like an intro, portfolio, and contact form. I designed it with accessibility and user experience in mind. Every element is carefully placed to help visitors get a quick overview of my capabilities and previous work.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

- Images are optimized for faster load times.
- Clean CSS structure for easier future edits.
- Layout built mobile-first using Flexbox and media queries.
- Considered accessibility by using semantic HTML elements.
